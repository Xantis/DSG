Things to lookat/consider while doing msgClass refactor
=======================================================
RegionSyncModule.m_savedSyncMessage
    Currently disabled (although most code is executed).
    Useful for hanging onto messages received for objects not created yet.
    Generalize into message saving mechanism that can be used for events,
    updates and operations.
Some messages expect to send the received binary buffer out again.
	Check those that to a resend (usually "Get*") and figure out how to
	make it so the data is not re-serialized.
	SyncMsgNewPresence
	SyncMsgNewObject
	Look for references to IsSyncRelay in SyncMsg.cs
Add ConvertIn to SyncMsg classes so decoding is in ConvertIn so it
	matches ConvertOut.
SyncMsgNewPresence is messed up: moves SyncInfo and not a ScenePresence.
SyncMsgRegionName needs work.
SyncMsgActorID needs work.
SyncMsgRegionStatus needs work.
The calls to base.ConvertIn and base.HandleIn return true/false. These
	values should be cheched and each layer properly return their success.
The generation of all the data for RegionSyncModule.SyncDelinkObject is messed up.
	Refer to the original code to figure out where 'groupSyncInfo' comes from.
RegionSyncModule.SyncStateDetailReport needs fixing.
RegionSyncModule.OnLocalNewScript generates an updated property list which causes
	the inventory to be updated. This is not being handled properly by
	SyncMsgnewScript.
The build  section to create the .dll files will fail due  the  new  8.1.1 codes and i assume also Bulletsim,
This needs to work in order to test DSG as at this  moment seems only ODE is working, this project is worth to proceed


What is the ending UUID on detail log messages? It seems to be always zero UUID.
